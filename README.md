## Description

This program simulates Fourier's Law of Thermal Conduction.

## Parameters

There are several parameters that can be adjusted. The codes needs to be edited to do so, under the *SET SYSTEM PARAMETERS* section.

* material of conductor (must be set to either copper, iron, or wood)
* area (square meters)
* length (meters)
* hot reservour temperature (Kelvin)
* cold reservour temperature (Kelvin)

## Output

This simulation prints results to screen. It also exports the results to a CSV file that
can be names by the user, which can be useful for multiple runs. The default fime name is *fourier_conduction_constant.csv*.
